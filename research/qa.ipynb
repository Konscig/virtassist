При этом расписание на наличие конфликтов Вы проверяете самостоятельно в соответствии с Вашим расписанием в ИС Модеус и расписанием спортивных секций (во вложенных файлах). Ваш выбор пролонгируется до конца семестра, однако в любой момент Вы можете его изменить, отписавшись от одной секции и записавшись на другую. ВАЖНО!  Студент, пропустивший два занятия подряд, будет отписан автоматически.
